  DESCRIPTION


COXBackgroundPainter class is designed to simplify the process of window 
background painting. It provides the functionality of painting the 
background of the window with specified image and/or color. 

For some reason background painting never been a trivial task. By default,
painting happens when WM_ERASEBKGND message is sent to window. If you
don't handle this message in any specific way then Windows use background
brush associated with the corresponding window class in order to fill
the background of the window. So in order to paint the window using 
different color you would have to handle WM_ERASEBKGND message or 
alternatively create new window class for your window with the brush of color
you need. 

Painting window's background with different color is neither difficult
nor interesting task. But painting background of window with some image 
(like Windows Desktop) could add some value to your application. 

COXBackgroundPainter class provides that kind of functionality. And it
takes only one function call in order to setup a window to be painted in new 
fancy way.

As a number of other Ultimate Toolbox classes COXBackgroundPainter class
is derived from COXHookWnd class. This class allows to handle any
messages before the hooked window does. Also internally COXBackgroundPainter
uses COXDIB object in order to draw 256> color images.

In order to set any window background to be painted using COXBackgroundPainter
object you have to hook such window using the following function:

	Attach()
	
In the function you specify the pointer to the window to be hooked, info
about the image to be used while painting the background (you can specify
COXDIB object, resource or file name), type of image drawing (Tile, 
Stretch, Center, ...), background color to be used to fill the window
background that is not covered by image (refer to the documentation on
this function for details), and pointer to the window which top/left point
of its paintable rectangle will be used as origin point for painting 
routines (this is very important if you need to align the background
among different child windows of the same parent window). 

It's highly probable that Attach() function will be the only one that you 
will use in your applications but we defined a set of additional functions 
that allows you to control all aspects of the class functionality.

Use Detach() function in order to unhook any attached window.
In order to change window background painting properties at run-time without 
detaching and attaching it use the following set of functions:
	
	SetWallpaper()
	SetPaintType()
	SetBkColor()
	SetOriginWindow()

To retrieve background painting properties call:

	GetWallpaperImage()
	GetPaintType()
	GetBkColor()
	GetOriginWindow()


As you can see it's really easy to use this class, but unfortunatly every
story has two sides. We mentioned above about the standard way Windows
paints the background of any window. It is TRUE for any window unless
specific window handles the process of its drawing and paints its
background in different way (e.g. in WM_PAINT handler). Almost all 
standard controls paint their background and almost all of them do this 
differently. E.g. some of the controls like tree control, list control or 
toolbar support powerful NM_CUSTOMDRAW notification. Others, like static 
or edit controls should handle WM_CTLCOLOR message in order to paint the 
background. And also we shouldn't forget about ownerdraw controls too!

The question is how to use COXBackgroundPainter class in such cases. 
There is no easy answer that will work for any control but generally
you can use the following approach:

	1)	Try to hook the control using Attach() function and test if 
		it paints the background correctly. If everything is alright
		then you are lucky and you are using the control that was designed 
		consistently with the Windows treat background painting.

	2)	Otherwise you have to provide the background painting for such control
		explicitly at some point depending on the functionality of 
		the control (refer to the documentation on the corresponding control 
		to make a decision where to put background painting code). You still 
		can use COXBackgroundPainter class in this case but at the 
		appropriate moment you have to explicitly call the following 
		function in order to paint the background:
	
			DrawWallpaper(CDC* pDC);

		You only have to specify the device context to paint the background in
		and this function will take care of everything else itself.



In most applicable cases (like painting the background of dialog, MDIClient
or View windows) COXBackgroundPainter class will work without any additional 
efforts from your side. But you still have to have one COXBackgroundPainter
object for every window that is going to be hooked. This could be a little
bit inconvinient, especially if you are going to provide background 
painting support for a number of windows within the same framework.


In order to simplify things we designed COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer class.
COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer provides very similar to COXBackgroundPainter
set of functions. E.g. the definition of Attach() function is completely
the same. The only difference is that when you call this function for new
window new COXBackgroundPainter object will be instantiated and its
Attach() function will be called. At any moment you can define whether 
given window is attached to a COXBackgroundPainter object calling function:

	IsAttached(const CWnd* pWnd);

You can retrieve the pointer to the COXBackgroundPainter object that
corresponds to the specified window using function:

	GetPainter(const CWnd* pWnd);


Refere to the COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer class reference documentation
for details on the rest of functions.


As long as COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer class provides almost the same 
functionality as COXBackgroundPainter does and it really simplify things
when you hook multiple windows within the same parent window, we suggest
that COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer should be used preferably. Below you 
will find some scenarios that can be used while implementing background
painting support.


	Dialog window with background:

	1)	Define COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer object in your CDialog 
		derived class

		class CMyDlg : public CDialog
		{
			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
		protected:
			COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer m_backPainterOrganizer;
			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
		}

	2)	Override OnInitDialog function and attach dialog window
		using COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer object

		BOOL CLogoDlg::OnInitDialog() 
		{
			CDialog::OnInitDialog();
	
			// TODO: Add extra initialization here
	
			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

			m_backPainterOrganizer.Attach(this,IDB_WALLPAPER);

			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

			return TRUE;  // return TRUE unless you set the focus to a control
					      // EXCEPTION: OCX Property Pages should return FALSE
		}
		
		We assume IDB_WALLPAPER is image ID that you want to use to fill
		the background. Using Attach() function the way it shawn here
		will tile the specified image to cover all background area, 
		default background color will be used and dialog itself will be used 
		as origin window.
		


	
	MDI frame window with toolbar.

	1)	Define COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer object and GetPainter() 
		function in your CMDIFrameWnd derived class

		class CMainFrame : public CMDIFrameWnd
		{
			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
		protected:
			COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer m_backPainterOrganizer;
			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
		public:
			inline COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer* GetPainter() {
				return &m_backPainterOrganizer; 
			}
			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
		}

	2)	Override OnCreate() function and after creating the toolbar use
		the following code:

		int CMainFrame::OnCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct)
		{
			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

			// hook toolbar after it was created and initialized
			m_backPainterOrganizer.Attach(&m_wndToolBar,IDB_WALLPAPER);

			CWnd* pMDIClient=CWnd::FromHandle(m_hWndMDIClient);
			// hook MDIClient window
			m_backPainterOrganizer.Attach(pMDIClient,IDB_WALLPAPER,Tile,
				CLR_DEFAULT,this);

			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

		}

	3)	In order to provide smooth background painting for frame window that 
		supports docking control bars we have to hook undocumented CDockBar
		controls that main frame window uses as placeholder for control bars.
		In order to do that you have to override the EnableDocking function
		in the following way:

		void CMainFrame::EnableDocking(DWORD dwDockStyle)
		{
			CMDIFrameWnd::EnableDocking(dwDockStyle);

			if(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_TOP)!=NULL &&
				!m_backPainterOrganizer.
				IsAttached(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_TOP)))
			{
				m_backPainterOrganizer.
					Attach(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_TOP),IDB_WALLPAPER,
						Tile,CLR_DEFAULT,this);
			}
			if(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_BOTTOM)!=NULL &&
				!m_backPainterOrganizer.
				IsAttached(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_BOTTOM)))
			{
				m_backPainterOrganizer.
					Attach(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_BOTTOM),IDB_WALLPAPER,
						Tile,CLR_DEFAULT,this);
			}
			if(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_LEFT)!=NULL &&
				!m_backPainterOrganizer.
				IsAttached(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_LEFT)))
			{
				m_backPainterOrganizer.
					Attach(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_LEFT),IDB_WALLPAPER,
						Tile,CLR_DEFAULT,this);
			}
			if(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_RIGHT)!=NULL &&
				!m_backPainterOrganizer.
				IsAttached(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_RIGHT)))
			{
				m_backPainterOrganizer.
					Attach(GetControlBar(AFX_IDW_DOCKBAR_RIGHT),IDB_WALLPAPER,
						Tile,CLR_DEFAULT,this);
			}
		}

		
	4)	If you want to paint the background of views too you can override
		OnCreate() function of your view class and use the following code:

		int CMyView::OnCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct) 
		{
			if (CView::OnCreate(lpCreateStruct) == -1)
				return -1;
			
			// TODO: Add your specialized creation code here
			
			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

			((CMainFrame*)AfxGetMainWnd())->GetPainter()->
				Attach(this,IDB_WALLPAPER);

			. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

			return 0;
		}





One	of an interesting aplication of COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer class
is the following: you want to display 256> color image in the About Box
of your company logo. If you use Picture (actually, CStatic control)
object to do that then you don't have palette support and the size of 
control will depend on the size of image. Instead you can do the following:

	1)	Create the window that will be used to display picture
	2)	Hook this window using COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer object and 
		specify the image that will be displayed
		
Pretty easy.





Special note:	How to use COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer to display 256> color
				bitmaps when 256 color video mode is set.

In order to do that we have to release the background image palette when
WM_PALETTECHANGED and WM_QUERYNEWPALETTE messages are sent to attached window.
It's implemented automatically for you in COXBackgroundPainter class but there is
small problem. WM_PALETTECHANGED and WM_QUERYNEWPALETTE messages are sent only
to top-level and overlapped windows. So background images will be correctly 
displayed for dialog or mainframe window, but for non-overlapped child windows 
you have to provide some way of notifying them that they have to update system 
palette. We suggest the following solution for your problem. In the class that
is guaranteed to get WM_PALETTECHANGED and WM_QUERYNEWPALETTE messages
(e.g. it could be your main frame window or dialog window) you include handlers
for them. In the handlers you forward these messages to the windows that are
hooked using COXBackgroundPainterOrganizer or alternatively you can send these 
messages to all descendand windows using CWnd::SendMessageToDescendants() function.






All above mentioned techniques are implemented in the BackgroundPainter 
sample that can be found in .\samples\gui\BackgroundPainter subdirectory
of your Ultimate Toolbox directory.

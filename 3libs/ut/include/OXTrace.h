  COXTrace
 
  Hierarchy:
 	COXTrace
 
 	COXTrace, and its supporting macros, provide an extension to the TRACE() macros that
  are supplied with MFC. These extensions include:
 	1. Built-in word wrapping
 	2. Copying of the trace output to a file
 	3. Automatic marking of the start and end of a block of code
 	4. Automatic indenting of the messages to provide a way to track nesting of COXTrace
 	   blocks.
  
  The macros provide a means for quickly removing all of the tracing code from your
  project, without editing your files.

// Description :
/*

OXSoundCustomizeDlg class is designed specifically to be used in conjunction with
COXSoundEffectOrganizer class and provides all the functionality to customize
any sound events registered with any window objects using COXSoundEffectOrganizer
object. We assume that you are familiar with the COXSoundEffectOrganizer class, 
if you are not then it's good idea to read the documentation on this class.

Briefly, using COXSoundEffectOrganizer object you can associate any sound event
(by sound event we mean playing sound while specific event has occured, e.g.
playing some sound when user clicks over button) with any window object. 
Different people could prefer to hear different sound or not to hear some of 
them at all. So it's good idea to provide some kind of customization functionality,
especially, taking into account the fact that there are such COXSoundEffectOrganizer
public functions as SaveState and LoadState which are designed specifically to 
save/load information registered about sound effects into/from the registry. 

Although you are free to provide your own solution we decided to come up with the 
standard dialog that can be easily used in any application and in most cases
doesn't require including of any code but the class' constructor. It is defined as
follows:

	COXSoundCustomizeDlg(CWnd* pParent, 
		COXSoundEffectOrganizer* pSoundEffectOrganizer,
		enum LEVELTYPE nStartLevel=LT_EVENT,
		DWORD dwDlgStyle=SCDS_NOTOGGLE);
	// --- In  :	pParent					-	pointer to the sound customize dialog 
	//											parent window. Can be NULL
	//				pSoundEffectOrganizer	-	pointer to the COXSoundEffectOrganizer
	//											object to be used as source of all 
	//											information about sound events to be 
	//											customized
	//				nStartLevel				-	Level to which the tree control used
	//											to display all sound events will be 
	//											expanded. We define three levels:
	//
	//						LT_WINDOW		-	display only titles of all windows 
	//											with which we associated any sounds.
	//						LT_EVENTLIST	-	display titles of windows and titles 
	//											of the lists of start playing and stop 
	//											playing events.
	//						LT_EVENT		-	display titles of windows, titles of
	//											lists of start playing and stop 
	//											playing events and all events.
	//				
	//				dwDlgStyle				-	specific sound customize dialog 
	//											styles. Can be any combination of next:
	//
	//						SCDS_READONLY	-	you can navigate through all stop and 
	//											start playing events but cannot change 
	//											them.
	//						SCDS_NOTOGGLE	-	you cannot expand or collapse any tree
	//											item
	//						SCDS_SAVESTATE	-	save in registry width of tree 
	//											columns, sort column and sort order
	//						SCDS_LOADSTATE	-	set saved in registry width of tree 
	//											columns, sort column and sort order
	//
	// --- Out :			
	// --- Returns:
	// --- Effect : Constructor


As you can see you have to specify only one parameter - pointer to the object of
COXSoundEffectOrganizer class. And optionally you can specify two additional 
parameters that have to do with dialog appearance.

It's worth mentioning that all sound effects are represented as multicolumn tree 
items. The structure of the tree schematically can be represented as follows:

		Type and text of window registered with any sound effect
			List of all playing events
				Event description	Name of sound source	Event ID	Loop
				Event description	Name of sound source	Event ID	Loop
				. . . . . . .

			List of all stop events
				Event description							Event ID	
				. . . . . . .

		Type and text of window registered with any sound effect
			. . . . . . . . .

		. . . . . . . . . . . 

Where	Event description		-	brief description of the event, e.g.: 
									"Left mouse button down"
		Name of sound source	-	sound source file name. Only sound effects
									that use files as sound sources are fully 
									editable. The sound effects that uses other 
									sound sources (e.g. resource ID) still will
									be displayed but you won't be able to change 
									the sound source.
		Event ID				-	sound event ID, e.g. WM_LBUTTONDOWN
		Loop					-	type of looping:
										once;
										indefinitely;
										specified number of times;


By default we populate array of all defined sound events. Next are defined:

	"Mouse enter"					HWM_MOUSEENTER
	"Mouse leave"					HWM_MOUSELEAVE
	"Left button down"				WM_LBUTTONDOWN
	"Left button up"				WM_LBUTTONUP
	"Left button double click"		WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK
	"Right button down"				WM_RBUTTONDOWN
	"Right button up"				WM_RBUTTONUP
	"Right button double click"		WM_RBUTTONDBLCLK
	"Middle button down"			WM_MBUTTONDOWN
	"Middle button up"				WM_MBUTTONUP
	"Middle button double click"	WM_MBUTTONDBLCLK


It's highly probable that you would define your own sound events that are not 
listed above. You can use next functions in order to edit array of defined
sound events:


	void SetEvent(UINT nEventID, LPCTSTR* ppszDescription);
	// --- In  :	nEventID		-	sound event identificator to set to the list
	//									which is displayed in "Event" combo box
	//				ppszDescription	-	pointer to array of two strings
	//									that provide description and additional 
	//									information about the specified event, e.g.
	BOOL RemoveEvent(UINT nEventID);

	void RemoveAllEvents();
	
	UINT GetEventCount();

	POSITION GetFirstEvent();
	// --- Returns: A POSITION value that indicates a starting position for iterating 
	//				the sound events in the list which is displayed in the 
	//				"Event" combo box; or NULL if there is no sound event.

	void GetNextEvent(POSITION& posEvent, UINT& nEventID, 
		LPCTSTR*& ppszDescription)
	// --- In  :	posEvent		-	Specifies a reference to a POSITION value 
	//									returned by a previous GetNextEvent or 
	//									GetFirstEvent call.
	// --- Out :	nEventID		-	referenced of the sound event ID found at
	//									posEvent position
	//				ppszDescription	-	reference of the sound event description 
	//									found at posEvent position. Event description
	//									defined as array of two strings	that provide 
	//									description and additional information about 
	//									the sound event


These are all public functions that are available in the class. 



COXSoundCustomizeDlg is an unusual example of the class that is heavily based on 
the existing Ultimate Toolbox classes. Next classes are used:

		COXTreeCtrl
		COXBitmapButton
		COXMultiComboBox
		COXHistoryCombo
		COXSound
		COXSoundEffectOrganizer



Probably the last thing that we should mention here is that any changes that 
could be made to the sound effects registered with the specified object of
COXSoundEffectOrganizer class will be applied immediately but won't be saved
automatically. It's your application's responsibility to provide all the code
to make all sound effects settings persistent. You can easily do that using
COXSoundEffectOrganizer public functions: SaveState(...) and LoadState(...)
